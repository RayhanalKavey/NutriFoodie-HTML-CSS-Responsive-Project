## About NutriFoodie

We are an online-based company, and our major focus is to deliver our customers nutritious food according to their diet plans. Most people are not very aware of their food nutrition because of their busy lives, and other important activities. This might cause health consequences, so we want to take that responsibility to make sure their nutrition. Our AI will produce a healthy plan according to our customer's diet plan. All they have to do is select the diet plan, and boom. User can set their plan for food and time for delivery. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
